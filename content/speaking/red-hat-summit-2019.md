On the 8th May 2018, I spoke at Red Hat Summit on three sessions named:

- _"Leverage the power of communities to manage your APIs"_ ([demo recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNOypl00o8))
- _"Istio, the missing link in the evolution of your API strategy"_ ([demo recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLTQNGslgB4))
- _"An APIcast policy in 15 minutes"_ ([demo recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1RJBW2N-Xg))
