During the three Red Hat Tech Exchange sessions (Americas, EMEA and APAC), I presented two sessions:

- _"Leverage the power of open source communities to manage your APIs"_ ([full recording](https://youtu.be/I2QutGqIzpA))
- _"Complementing your Istio Service Mesh with 3scale and Fuse"_ ([demo recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvrnzc7b9qw))

The session _Leverage the power of open source communities to manage your APIs_ has been the second best voted session in RHTE APAC!
