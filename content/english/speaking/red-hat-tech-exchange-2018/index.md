From the 17th to 21th Septembre 2018, I co-presented two sessions:

- _An API Journey: from mock to deployment_, with Laurent Broudoux
- _API Lifecycle Automation_, with Manfred Bortenschlager

For the session _An API Journey: from mock to deployment_, we received an award
based on the amazing feedbacks from the public!
