This is the third part of my series covering how to
[Write workshop instructions with Hugo](../writing-workshop-instructions-with-hugo/). In this article, we will deploy our [Hugo mini-training](https://github.com/nmasse-itix/hugo-workshop/) as a container in OpenShift.

<!--more-->

Since Hugo is a static website generator, we only need a web server in our container to serve those pages. Let's settle for nginx that is [neatly packaged as a container image, as part of the Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-nginx114/).

And to build our final container image that will contain both our website (the static pages to serve) and the web server itself, we will use the [Source-to-image (S2I)](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) tool. Hopefully, the nginx image of the Software Collections is already S2I enabled!

## Install the Source-to-Image tool

The S2I tool comes as package for Fedora or RHEL distributions, named `source-to-image`. On RHEL, you will have to enable the `rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms` channel before.

On a RHEL system, use:

```sh
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
sudo yum install source-to-image
```

On a Fedora system, use:

```sh
sudo dnf install source-to-image
```

On MacOS, use:

```sh
brew install source-to-image
```

You can confirm the S2I tool is installed by running:

```raw
$ s2i version
s2i v1.1.6
```

## Pull the nginx container image

If you are a Red Hat customer, you should be able to use the Red Hat official images:

```sh
docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/nginx-114-rhel7:latest
```

Or if you prefer, you can use the image provided by the community:

```sh
docker pull centos/nginx-114-centos7:latest
```

## Customize the S2I assemble script

The off-the-shelf nginx container image comes with standard S2I scripts that takes a GIT repository of static files and publish them *as-is*. We need to customize those scripts to call Hugo to generates the static files and replace the content of the GIT repository with those static files.

Hopefully, S2I comes with a nice mechanism to override the standard scripts. We only need to place our scripts in a `.s2i/bin/` directory in our GIT repository. There are two standard scripts: `assemble` (to build the container image) and `run` to start the process from the container image. We will override the `assemble` script.

Create a `.s2i/bin/assemble` file in your GIT repository with the following content:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Exit on any error
set -e

hugo_version=${HUGO_VERSION:-0.54.0}
hugo_bin_name=${HUGO_BIN_NAME:-hugo_${hugo_version}_Linux-64bit.tar.gz}
hugo_bin_url=${HUGO_BIN_URL:-https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${hugo_version}/${hugo_bin_name}}

# Download Hugo
curl -s -o "/tmp/${hugo_bin_name}" -L  "${hugo_bin_url}"

# Install Hugo
tar -C /tmp -xf "/tmp/${hugo_bin_name}" hugo

# Build the website
mv /tmp/src/ /tmp/git
/tmp/hugo -s /tmp/git
ln -s /tmp/git/public /tmp/src

# Call the default S2I assemble script
exec /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble
```

Make it executable:

```sh
chmod 755 .s2i/bin/assemble
```

Check that your customized `assemble` script is working by running the `s2i build` command:

```sh
s2i build -c . centos/nginx-114-centos7:latest hugo-mini-training
```

The `-c` switch is mandatory here to use our local copy of the GIT repository since it contains changes not yet committed.
If you want the Red Hat official image, adjust the `s2i build` command to replace `centos/nginx-114-centos7:latest` with `registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/nginx-114-rhel7:latest`.

You should see the typical Hugo output as part of the build logs:

```raw
Building sites â€¦
| EN
+------------------+----+
Pages            | 22
Paginator pages  |  0

Sitemaps         |  1
Cleaned          |  0

Total in 36 ms

Build completed successfully
```

Commit and push your changes:

```sh
git add .s2i/bin/assemble
git commit -m 'add s2i support'
git push
```

## Deploy on OpenShift

Once your repository contains the customized S2I script, you can deploy your website on OpenShift using the standard S2I mechanisms.

```sh
oc new-app centos/nginx-114-centos7:latest~https://github.com/nmasse-itix/hugo-workshop.git --name=hugo-workshop
```

If you want the Red Hat official image, adjust the previous command to replace `centos/nginx-114-centos7:latest` with `registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/nginx-114-rhel7:latest`. Also, do not forget to change the URL to point to your GIT repository instead!

By default, the custom `assemble` script will build your website with Hugo 0.54.0 (latest version when this post was written) but you can use the version of your choice by setting the `HUGO_VERSION` accordingly.

For instance, you can downgrade to Hugo 0.53 with:

```sh
oc set env bc/hugo-workshop HUGO_VERSION=0.53
```

## Continous Deployment

Part of the hype around Hugo is due to the level of automation you can achieve and especially Continous Deployment. This means the writer pushes his changes to a GIT repository and the website is rebuilt and deployed immediately, in an automated manner. The good news is that you can achieve this very easily with OpenShift!

First, get the GitHub Webhook URL of your BuildConfig:

- Connect to your OpenShift Web Console
- Go to **Builds** > **Builds**
- Click on your BuildConfig (`hugo-workshop` in the example)
- Open the **Configuration** tab
- Copy the **GitHub Webhook URL**

Then, go on your GitHub repository and add a webhook:

- Go to **Settings** > **Webhooks**
- Click **Add webhook**

![Add a webhook on GitHub](github-add-webhook.png)

- Paste your Webhook URL in the **Payload URL** field
- Select `application/json` in the **Content type** dropdown list
- Check **Disable** in the **SSL verification** section if your OpenShift console has a self-signed certificate
- Click **Add webhook**

Try to push some changes to your GitHub repository and see OpenShift rebuilding and deploying your website!

## Conclusion

In this article we presented a way to deploy a Hugo website as a container in OpenShift and achieve Continuous Deployment.
