If like me you are using [an RSS reader](../deploying-miniflux-openshift/) to stay informed, there is nothing more frustrating than reading a website that does not advertise an RSS feed.

But since most website are based on commonly found CMS, it is highly probable the RSS feeds are there, just not advertised.

Here are the URL patterns for the most common CMS on the market:

- **Wordpress**: `/feed/` or `/?feed=rss2`
- **Drupal**: `/rss.xml`
- **Wix**: `/blog-feed.xml`
- **YouTube Channel**: `https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<channel_id>`
