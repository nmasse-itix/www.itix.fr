Do you need something from me ?

For any inquiry about speaking, writing or engagement, you can contact me directly at my
email address or on twitter at [@nmasse_itix](https://twitter.com/nmasse_itix).

If you want to know more about my professional career, you can find it on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasmasse/) but I can also provide a current CV or bio upon request.

If you are reaching out to me for one of my [Open Source projects](/opensource/) or one of my
contributions, please open an issue in the relevant GitHub repository and mention [@nmasse-itix](https://github.com/nmasse-itix/)

Note about emails: I generally do not commit to a specific response time or any response at all
unless your email is clear, straight to the point and has something to do with my centers of
interest.
